        <h1>Re: Eileen Dover university application</h1>
        <p>Dear Eileen,</p>
        <p>Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's
            science faculty to study as part <br> of your <abbr title="PHD">PhD</abbr> next year.
            I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.</p>

        <h1>Starting dates</h1>
        <p>We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time,
            however it would suit us better if you <br> could start at the beginning of a semester;
            the start dates for each one are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>First semester: 9 September 2016</li>
            <li>Second semester: 15 January 2017</li>
            <li>Third semester: 2 May 2017</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.</p>
        <p>You can find more information about <a href=""> important university dates </a> on our website.</p>
        <h1>Subjects of study</h1>
        <p>At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility as long as the subjects <br>
            fall somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher,
            and just <br> the kind of person we'd like to have on our team.
            Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued <br> by are as follows, in order of priority:
        </p>

        <ol type="1" start="1">

            <li>Turning H2O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C14H1203.) </li>
            <li> Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30°C (86°F), when the
                <br>
                audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 x 10 increasing to 3 x 10+)</li>
            <li> <abbr title="Hyper text markup languge"> HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="cascading style sheet">
                    CSS</abbr>
                constructs for representing musical scores.</li>

        </ol>

        <p>So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the
            <br>
            research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.
        </p>
        <h1>Exotic dance moves</h1>
        <p>Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic tribal dances. To answer your
            question, <br>
            my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:</p>

        <dl>
            <dt>Polynesian chicken dance</dt>
            <dd>A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC,
                a whole village would dance around <br> in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be
                "fruitful</dd>
            <dt>Icelandic brownian shuffle</dt>
            <dd>Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which <br>
                involved
                huddling close together in
                a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in
                imperceptibly <br> tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow
                students used to say that he thought this dance inspired <br> modern styles such as Twerking.</dd>
                <dt>Arctic robot dance</dt>
                <dd>An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed to have <br>

                    discovered a new dance style characterised by "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by 
                    inhabitants <br> of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was 
                    discovered that they were just moving like this <br>
                     because they were really cold.</dd>
